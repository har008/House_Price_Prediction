## General Information
- The datashape is 1460,81
- Lasso and Regression techniques are utilized
- Here we tried to model the price of houses with the given feature variable
- We are using the House Price Prediction dataset.


## Conclusions
- There are 29 out of 81 variables found significant for the model.
- The Categorical columns played important role in predicting the prices.
- GrLivArea, OverallQual, Neighborhood, KitchenQual, BsmtExposure were the top 5 significant features
- Number of required variables were increased from 29 to 32 after removing top 5 variables. 


## Technologies Used
- pandas - 2.2.1
- numpy  - 1.24.4
- matplotlib - 3.8.4
- seaborn - 0.13.2
